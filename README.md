MyAutoML is a project that aims to help data scientists become more efficient, by providing:

- Cookiecutter templates
- Example scripts (based on the Cookiecutter templates)
- A Python package with functions to perform common tasks
- A programming framework to automate as much as possible of the repetitive
  work a data scientist is likely to encounter.

This project is created specifically to inspect newly written tutorials or other documentation on read the docs. Once
validated this documentation is added to the main project.
